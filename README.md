# roc-parser
A port of Elm's Parser library to roc, empowered by Roc's type system





## TODO

  1. Implement Elm's parser as a parser of List U8.
  2. Generalize Elm's parser to generic input. (if possible!)
  3. "Rocify" the parser to better match the idioms of Roc.
      - Accumulate errors bit by bit?
      - combinators for backpassing notation?
      - Clever types for context?
